# Hi!

You are currently on the web version of the Metada Extension. 

## Installation

You are only 2 clicks away from getting the extension! Install the extension from the official stores: [**Chrome**](https://bit.ly/metadaChrome) [**Firefox**](https://bit.ly/metadaFirefox)


The Extension's goal is to remind you of the ownership challenges in the media, fitting in you habits by simply notfying you about the owners. It will allow you to:

* Access the graph anytime (including offline)
* Get a notification about the media's ownership when visiting its website
* Gather a few statistics about your news consumption


We try to provide as many functionalities of the original project as we can. There may however be layout erros (for now!).

## About the Extension

The extension is currently under development. For the first version only the French media are available but with the possibility for users to suggest edits to the graph it should grow fast with the next version.


If you are a developper or web designer and want to get involved (frontend or backend) do get in touch (see "Contact")!
